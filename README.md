# COVID-INDIA
A JS based Covid-19 tracker for India.
Data aquired via https://api.covid19india.org/

Started as a hobby project in Mar 2020 during the lockdown period; aim being to have a simple, minimal tracker without the bells and whistles that may other trackers had.

Moved this to Github as of 31 May 2020, mainly to get familiar with Git/GitHub usage.

Fully functional page is available currently at: https://nc-covid.netlify.app/
This repository will be updated in stages to reach the final version over the coming days (as of 31 May 2020). This is mainly to get used to GitHub.
