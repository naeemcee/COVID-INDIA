A JS based Covid-19 tracker for India.
Data aquired via https://api.covid19india.org/

Starte as a hobby project in Mar 2020 during the lockdown period, aim was to have a simple, minimal tracker without the bells and whistles that may other tracker had.

Continuing to develop this by moving to Github as of end May 2020, mainly to get familiar with Git/GitHub usage.
