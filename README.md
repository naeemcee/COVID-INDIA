# COVID-INDIA
A JS based Covid-19 tracker for India.
Data aquired via https://api.covid19india.org/

Started as a hobby project in Mar 2020 during the lockdown period; aim being to have a simple, minimal tracker without the bells and whistles that may other trackers had.

Decided to move this to Github as of end May 2020, mainly to get familiar with Git/GitHub usage.
